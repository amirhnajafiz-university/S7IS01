Scanning hosts to find information about their status and open ports. A basic step to hack hosts. Host Scanner is my first **Data Security** course project at **CEIT/AUT**. It uses tools like **nmap** and **ping** to get information about a host and it's ports.

## Run project

```shell
sudo python3 main.py
```

### Options

- Ping Host
- Scan range of Hosts
- Scan range of Ports of a Host

### Output

You can find the results of each operation in ```result_[OPERATION].txt```
